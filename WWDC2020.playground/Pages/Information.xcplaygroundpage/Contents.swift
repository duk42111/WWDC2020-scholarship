 ### Inspiration
 
Since childhood, I have been interested in astronomy and make it popular among friends, and now becoming an iOS developer, I know how to translate this knowledge into a visual representation that will help schoolchildren and students from all over the world also learn a lot about the universe in which we live. In particular, to show on what small planet we live in comparison with even the planets of our solar system and recall that only on it we have life and we must protect it.
 
 ### Resources
 
 All planet textures are taken from licensed free sources

 # What for?
 
 My playground can be a great demonstration in physics and astronomy classes to understand the real scale of the planets relative to each other
